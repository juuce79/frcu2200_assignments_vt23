/**
 * Provides classes for managing and executing commands in a game of Hanoi. 
 * The specific classes are {@code CommandInterface}, {@code MoveCommand}, {@code NewGameCommand}, and {@code ShowCommand}. 
 * Each class represents a specific action in the game, including moving a disc between towers, 
 * starting a new game with a specified number of discs, and displaying the current state of the game.
 * These commands interact with the HanoiEngine to manipulate the game state and with HanoiLogger to log game events.
