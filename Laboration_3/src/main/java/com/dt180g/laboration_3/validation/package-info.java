/**
 * Provides the {@code InvalidInputException} and {@code InvalidMoveException} classes that are used for error handling in the Towers of Hanoi game.
 * The {@code InvalidInputException} is a runtime exception used to indicate that the user has provided invalid input for the game. 
 * It does not need to be explicitly caught and handled by the caller. It formats the provided error message with ANSI color codes 
 * to display the message in red.
 * The {@code InvalidMoveException} is a similar runtime exception, used to indicate that the user has attempted an invalid move in the game. 
 * It also formats the error message with ANSI color codes for highlighted display.
